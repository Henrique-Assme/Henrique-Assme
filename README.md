# üëã Hi there

I'm Henrique Assme, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I'm currently finishing my Computer Engineer degree and starting my masters degree in Deep Reinforcement Learning. </br>
With over 3 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies on internships, junior enterprise and personal projects.

# üöÄ Expertise

I'm passionate about the whole process of software developing, I define myself as a full-stack developer, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. My 3 years of experience have led me to challenging projects, such as designing scalable systems, developing a desktop application, and building a real-time trading platform using FastAPI, React, and Kafka.

In my professional journey so far, I've proudly served as a full-stack developer on two internships and a backend developer on one internship, as well as a Project Analyst on my college Junior Enterprise.
